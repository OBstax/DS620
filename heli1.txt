The goal is for the blade to defy gravity and
stay exactly where it is when we remove the stand. If we do
nothing before removing the stand, the blade will simply fall
to the ground. Can we exert a force (a push or pull) opposite
gravity that equals the 100 lb. weight of the blade? Yes, for
example, electromagnetic force could be used. In helicopters,
however, we use aerodynamic force to oppose weight and
to maneuver.
Every object in the atmosphere is surrounded by a gas that
exerts a static force of 2,116 lb per square foot (a force
times a unit area, called pressure) at sea level. However, that
pressure is exerted equally all over the blade (top and bottom)
and therefore does not create any useful force on the blade.
We need only create a difference of a single pound of static
pressure differential per square foot of blade surface to have a
force equal to the bladeâ€™s weight (100 lb of upward pressure
opposite 100 lb downward weight).
Total pressure consists of static pressure and, if the air is
moving, dynamic pressure (a pressure in the direction of the
air movement).
