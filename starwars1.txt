Before you go jetting off to Zeffo be sure to make a detour to Dathomir to pick up a major lightsaber upgrade, but just be warned, Dathomir is no walk in the park and you will face enemies much more powerful than those that you had initially encountered on Bogano.

Dathomir is pretty straight forward and only has one main path that you can follow. Eventually, after fighting your way through the Brotherhood and the Bane Back Spiders, you will come across a hooded stranger in Brother's Bastion who informs you that you aren’t quite ready to take on the rest of Dathomir’s challenges just yet.

Instead of heading back to your ship defeated, look for a pathway towards the left side of the area that heads into a small cave.

Along this path, you will find workbench that has a special attachment that unlocks the Double-Bladed Lightsaber.
