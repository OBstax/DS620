Hold the beer bottle and the bottle opener in opposite hands. Grip the beer bottle by the base of the bottle. Hold the bottle opener by the handle so the flat end with the cut-out section in the middle is exposed.
It may be easiest for you to hold the bottle opener with your dominant hand.


Wedge the sharp edge of the opener under the side of the bottle cap. Look at the cut-out section on the flat end of the bottle opener. The edge of the cut-out section closest to the handle is the edge you want to wedge under the bottle cap.
After you wedge the sharp edge of the bottle opener under the bottle cap, the opposite edge of the cutout section should be resting on the top of the bottle cap.


Lift the handle of the bottle opener up with your dominant hand. As you lift the handle up, the far edge of the cut-out section of the bottle opener will press down on top of the bottle cap. At the same time, the sharp edge of the bottle opener will lift up the side of the cap, causing the cap to bend upward and pop off of the bottle.


Discard or recycle the bottle cap. Once the bottle cap is off the beer bottle, you can set the bottle opener aside and enjoy your beer!
