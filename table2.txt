Put on a pair of rubber gloves, open your stainer, and mix it according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, dip a foam brush or rag into the stainer. Wipe it all the way along the table’s grain without stopping. Cover the entire table before wiping up excess stainer with a rag.

Let the stain dry overnight before attempting to add more. Chances are the stain will look a little dull and uneven at first. Stain the table again the same way you did before, then let it dry again. When you return, your table should be all set.
